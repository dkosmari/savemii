    <long_description>WiiU/vWii Save Manager

        This homebrew allows you to backup your Wii U and vWii savegames to the SD card and then restore them. Can also
        copy saves from NAND<->USB if title is installed to both. Up to 256 backups can be made per title. Backups are
        stored in sd:/wiiu/backups. Savedata can be moved between profiles. All operations can be performed on multiple
        titles at once.
